What is the main idea of this paragraph? In our daily lives, technology plays a vital part. We use it in a variety of situations. However, I am a firm believer in wisely using technology in a manner that does not cause harm or addiction. It's important to remember that technology is a double-edged sword.

Also, I am opposed to employing it in place of humans; in many sectors, technology cannot replace people. For example, teaching necessitates direct touch between students and teachers.
